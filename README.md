## The behavior of our repeat user vs new user
_Disclaimer:_

I defined user that customer who purchase the product and cart the product (written as "not_view")

_New customer: not_view_count is just one_

_Repeat customer: not_view_count is more than one_

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/88583319/130017090-f76c3a21-7d09-4725-a757-4ad6afcf6faf.png)

_The difference between the behavior of new users and repeat users is that new users tend to purchase the product right away rather than adding the product to their cart. This is because new users when opening e-commerce only focuses on purchasing products. Whereas repeat users when opening e-commerce only to see the latest products, if like the products, repeat users tend to add products to the cart first, then repeat users are still considering buying or not and comparing one product with other products. If the product is as expected, repeat users will buy the product._
